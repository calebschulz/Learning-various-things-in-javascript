# Co-op Astroid Shooter Game
This is a project that was done for the CENG 356 class at the University of Victoria. This project takes a single player game created by [SteupandDraw](https://github.com/SetupandDraw) and adds a server that allows two players to play it cooperatively.

## How to play
1. Ensure you have Node install on your machine (v8.6 was used in development)
2. Start up the server
3. Connect two clients to the server 
Note: Currently the server is hardcoded to listen to port 3000.
4. Control spaceship with the following controls:
    - Left arrow: rotate spaceship anti-clockwise
    - Right arrow: rotate spaceship clockwise
    - Up arrow: accelerate spaceship
    - Spacebar: fire projectile
